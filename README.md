https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027

<br> 

## Overview:

"Learn to design data models, build data warehouses and data lakes, automate data pipelines, and work with
massive datasets. At the end of the program, youâ€™ll combine your new skills by completing a capstone project.
Students should have intermediate SQL and Python programming skills.
Educational Objectives: Students will learn to
- Create user-friendly relational and NoSQL data models
- Create scalable and efficient data warehouses
- Work efficiently with massive datasets
- Build and interact with a cloud-based data lake
- Automate and monitor data pipelines
- Develop proficiency in Spark, Airflow, and AWS tools"
